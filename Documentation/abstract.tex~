The development of computer applications on embedded devices,
such as FPGAs, is great of interest to the  industry information security,
enabling them to create computer systems targeted to a specific task 
without the need for a computing full system.



Today, FPGAs are devices that allow the implementation of complex security
systems based on hardware or software providing developers with a high range of
possibilities to implement systems on them.
