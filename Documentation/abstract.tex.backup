The development of computer applications on embedded devices,
such as FPGAs, is great of interest to industry information security,
enabling them to create computer systems targeted to a specific task 
without the need for a system full computation.

Currently, there are many security systems based on software. Some provide
acceptable stability and are integrated operating system, others such as
graphical interfaces are only that facilitate the task of managing the security
of a computer system to Most users and also provide security to use default
basic. The latter, in more demanding environments do not provide a
reliable response to a cyber attack.

Today, FPGAs are devices that allow the implementation of complex security
systems based on hardware or software providing developers with a high range of
possibilities to implement systems on them.
