The development of computer applications on embedded devices,
such as FPGAs, is great of interest to the  industry information security,
enabling them to create computer systems targeted to a specific task 
without the need for a computing full system.

Currently, there are many security systems based on software. Some of them 
provide acceptable stability and are integrated with the operating system,
others are only a graphical interfaces that facilitate the task of
managing the security of a computer system to most users and also provide
security to default basic use. These last, in more demanding environments do not
provide a reliable response to a cyber attack.

Today, FPGAs are devices that allow the implementation of complex security
systems based on hardware or software providing developers with a high range of
possibilities to implement systems on them.
